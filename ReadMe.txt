Real-World Implementation Notes:
For a production version, you'd need to:
    1. API Integration: Connect to actual platform APIs:
        ◦ eBay Trading API 
        ◦ Etsy Open API 
        ◦ Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) 
        ◦ Shopify Admin API 
    2. Database: Replace in-memory storage with a proper database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
    3. Authentication: Implement OAuth flows for each platform
    4. Error Handling: Add robust error handling for API failures
    5. Batch Operations: Support bulk updates and inventory imports
    6. Reporting: Add analytics and inventory reports
    7. Notifications: Email/SMS alerts for low stock or sync failures
The app demonstrates the core inventory management workflow and user interface you'd need. Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect or add additional features like barcode scanning, supplier management, or advanced reporting?
